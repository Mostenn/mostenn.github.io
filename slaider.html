                            </strong>By Emily Dickinson</p>
                        <p><em>Ah, Teneriffe!</em><br>
                            <em>Retreating Mountain!</em><br>
                            <em>Purples of Ages — pause for you — </em><br>
                            <em>Sunset — reviews her Sapphire Regiment —</em><br>
                            <em>Day — drops you her Red Adieu!</em></p>
                        <p><em>Still — Clad in your Mail of ices —</em><br>
                            <em>Thigh of Granite — and thew — of Steel —</em><br>
                            <em>Heedless — alike — of pomp — or parting</em></p>
                        <p><em>Ah, Teneriffe!</em><br>
                            <em>I’m kneeling — still —</em></p>
                        <p>Four of Dickinson’s poems concern mountains, the best of which, <em>“Ah Teneriffe”</em>, takes its inspiration from a mountain in the Canary Islands. The mountain is transfigured into a fearsome warrior clad in icy armor to whom the royalty of this world — the “Purples of Ages” — defers. All the poet can do is bow in the mountain’s presence.</p>

                        <p><strong>“</strong>There are two types of pain, the one that breaks you and the one that changes you. In the gym, pain is felt as a result of weakness leaving the body. Physical pain is the pain of transformation and the pain of progress. The more you endure, the harder it becomes to accept the thought of failure.<strong>”</strong> – <strong>Greg Plitt</strong></p>
